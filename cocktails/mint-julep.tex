\subsubsection{Description}
Anyone who is into horse racing will be familiar with this, the traditional drink of the Kentucky Derby during which some 80,000 juleps are served. Traditionally Mint Juleps are served in silver or pewter cups and held by the handle or rim in order for the cup to obtain optimum frost. As an alternative to muddling the mint and sugar cube you can also infuse a sugar syrup with mint. With this much bourbon in a drink, slow sipping is the appropriate way to imbibe. 

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2 1/2 oz bourbon
    \item leaves from 4-5 mint sprigs*
    \item 2 sugar cubes or 1/2 oz sugar syrup*
    \item mint sprig for garnish
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Place the mint and simple syrup or sugar into a julep cup, collins glass or double old-fashioned glass.
    \item Muddle well to dissolve the sugar and to release the oil and aroma of the mint.
    \item Add the bourbon
    \item Fill with crushed ice and stir well until the glass becomes frosty.
    \item Garnish with the mint sprig. 
\end{enumerate}

* Alternatively, you can use mint infused simple syrup to remove the need for muddling.
