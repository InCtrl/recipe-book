\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 tablespoon olive oil
    \item 1 large onion, diced
    \item 4 carrots, peeled and diced
    \item 1 red pepper, seeded and diced
    \item 2 large cloves garlic, minced
    \item 2 teaspoons cumin
    \item 2 teaspoons coriander
    \item 1 cup dried chickpeas
    \item 1 can (28 ounces) chopped tomatoes with juice
    \item 2 cinnamon sticks
    \item 2 1/2 cups vegetable or chicken broth
    \item 1 bunch kale, chopped and tough stems removed
    \item 1 bunch parsley, chopped
    \item 1/2 teaspoon salt
    \item Black pepper
    \item 1/2 roast chicken, skinned and boned (optional)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add olive oil, onion, carrots, red pepper, garlic, spices, chickpeas, tomatoes and juice, cinnamon sticks, and chicken broth to the slow cooker. Cook on high for 6 hours.
    \item Twenty minutes before serving, when the cooker is just on the "warm" setting, add kale. (This is a good time to prep rice, if desired: Add 1 cup basmati rice, 2 cups chicken or vegetable stock, and 1 pinch saffron in a pot, cover, bring to a boil, and reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes). Just before serving, add parsley and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remove cinnamon sticks and serve over rice with roasted chicken, if desired.
