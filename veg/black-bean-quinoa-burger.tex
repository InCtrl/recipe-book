\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 can (15.5 ounces) black beans, rinsed and drained
    \item 1/2 cup cooked quinoa
    \item 1/2 teaspoon cumin
    \item 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    \item 1/2 teaspoon paprika
    \item 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
    \item 1 tablespoon nutritional yeast
    \item 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for cooking
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
    \item In a medium bowl, combine all ingredients using hands or a fork to mash beans and thoroughly mix. (This should form a paste-like mixture that is easy to shape into patties.)
    \item Divide mixture into four equal balls, and form each into a patty between 1/4- and 1/2-inch thick.
    \item In a medium oven-safe saucepan over high eat, cook patties in 1/2 tablespoon olive oil for 1 minute on each side, or until lightly browned.
    \item Transfer the saucepan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Serve patties on whole-grain buns or over fresh greens with desired toppings.
