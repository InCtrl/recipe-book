  \item 4 egg
  \item 1 can refried beans
  \item 1 can red enchilada sauce

\subsection{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Set oven to broil.
  \item In a large bowl, mix tortilla chips and salsa.
  \item Chop the onion.
  \item In a medium bowl, combine refried beans, onion, and $\frac{1}{4}$ can of enchilada sauce.
  \item Once the oven is warm, put salsa coated chips on a baking sheet, reduce temperature to 200 F, and place chips in the oven.
  \item Prepare the eggs in any style that you prefer (I generally make sunny-side up eggs).
  \item Once eggs are done, remove chips from oven and place on plates. Top chips with the refried bean mixture, followed by the eggs.
