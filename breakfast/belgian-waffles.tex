\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1 3/4 cups of flour
    \item 2 tsp. baking powder
    \item 3 tsp. of sugar
    \item 1/2 tsp. salt
    \item 1/3 cup of vegetable oil
    \item 1 1/2 cups of milk
    \item 3 eggs separated (beat yolks and combine with milk)
    \item 3 egg whites beaten till stiff
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Measure dry ingredients in large bowl and blend.
    \item Combine the egg yolks and milk in small bowl.
    \item Stir in dry ingredients. Stir in oil.
    \item Carefully fold in egg whites. Do not over mix.
    \item Heat your waffle maker. Spray once with cooking spray.
    \item I usually use about 2 Tablespoons of batter in each quarter of waffle sometimes you need a little more in the middle use your judgement. Once the waffle maker stops steaming I usually turn the waffle over for a minute just to make sure its brown on both sides.
    \item Enjoy with maple syrup or Cool Whip and fruit!!
