Inactive Time: 4 hours |
Total Time: 12 hours

\subsection{Ingredients}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 2-3 lb beef sirloin or round steak (cut into thin 1x3 inch strips)
    \item 2 clove garlic (minced)
    \item 3 tbsp ginger (minced)
    \item 1 tbsp oyster sauce
    \item 1 tsp curry powder
    \item 1 tsp salt
    \item 1 tsp pepper
    \item 1-2 tbsp rum, whiskey, or sake (optional)
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Preparation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let marinade 4-24 hours
    \item For oven drying, place meat on tin foil lightly greased with vegetable or olive oil (but better is on an oven safe rack to allow better air flow). 
    \item Set oven to 140-150F (or as low as possible) and dry for 4-8 hours (or more) until the strips are still flexible but fibers around the edge break (if the entire piece breaks in half it has dried too long).
\end{enumerate}
